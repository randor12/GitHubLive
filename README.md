## Welcome to GitHub Live
The purpose of this code is to allow for live updating of code. The current edition allows the user to just press Ctrl + S to automatically save, commit, push, and pull code from GitHub. 

### Future Goals

```markdown
# LIVE UPDATING
- We would like to Make the code automatically save and update GitHub
# Multi-Person Coding
- The ultimate goal is to allow multiple people to code on the same file 
  and update code directly similar to Google Docs. 
  This would allow for more people to code simultaneously. 
  Teams would be able to get work done faster
```
